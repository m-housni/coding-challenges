# Coding Challenges
A list of coding challenges I've solved in different languages
1. D0: basic
2. D1: easy
3. D2: hard
4. D3: very hard

## Largest prime factor
* The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
* What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

## Even Fibonacci numbers
* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
* 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
* By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Multiples of p and q (D1)
* If we list all the natural numbers below N that are multiples of p or q. 
* (?) Find the sum of all the multiples of p or q below N.

## Multiples of 3 and 5 (D1)
* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
* The sum of these multiples is 23.
* (?) Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## findTarget (D0)
Given a list of integers and a target integer this function will return the index of the target if it exists or None (null in python)

## hasInfiniteLoop (D3)
Write a function which takes a peice of code as input and returns true if the program has an infinite loop and false otherwise.
