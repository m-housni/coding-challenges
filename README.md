# Coding Challenges
A list of coding challenges I've solved in different languages
1. D0: basic
2. D1: easy
3. D2: hard
4. D3: very hard

## Project Euler

* Problems solved: 1,2,3,4,5

## Smallest multiple 
* 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
* What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## is Pelindrom (D0)
* example pelindroms: 121, 33, 3223, 435534
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D0/isPelindrom.py

## Number to array (D0)
* Covert an integer to an array
* Example: 123 => [1,2,3], 4354 => [4,3,5,4]
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D0/numberToArray.py

## Largest palindrome product
* A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
* Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D1/largestPelindromProduct.py

## Largest prime factor
* The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
* What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D1/largestPrimeFactor.js

## Even Fibonacci numbers
* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
* 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
* By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D1/evenFibonacciNumbers.js

## Multiples of p and q (D1)
* If we list all the natural numbers below N that are multiples of p or q. 
* (?) Find the sum of all the multiples of p or q below N.
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D1/multiplesPnQ.js

## Multiples of 3 and 5 (D1)
* If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
* The sum of these multiples is 23.
* (?) Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
* Answer: 233168

## findTarget (D0)
Given a list of integers and a target integer this function will return the index of the target if it exists or None (null in python)
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/tree/main/difficulty_0/findTarget

## hasInfiniteLoop (D3)
Write a function which takes a peice of code as input and returns true if the program has an infinite loop and false otherwise.
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/tree/main/diffuculty_3/hasInfiniteLoop

## searchSubArraysSumsToK (D2)
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals k.

## sortingAlgorithms (D2)
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Swap sort
4. Insertion sort
5. Merge sort
6. Quick sort
