# Coding Challenges
A list of coding challenges I've solved in different languages
1. D0: basic
2. D1: easy
3. D2: hard
4. D3: very hard

## Project Euler
* https://projecteuler.net/archives
* Problems solved: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

## Longest Collatz sequence
* The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
* n → n/2 (n is even)
* n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
* Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
* 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
* It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is * thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
* Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
* NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
* 

## Target number from two arrays
* example: given two arrays of same length:
* [-1,3,8,2,9,5]
* [4,1,2,10,5,20]
* and a target number like 24
* find two numbers one belongs to the 1st array, the second belongs the 2nd array whom sum is the closest to the target number
* https://github.com/m-housni/coding-challenges/blob/main/D2/targetNumberFromTwoArrays.py

## Highly divisible triangular number
* The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first * ten terms would be:
* 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
* Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
*  1: 1
*  3: 1,3
*  6: 1,2,3,6
* 10: 1,2,5,10
* 15: 1,3,5,15
* 21: 1,3,7,21
* 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
* We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
* What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Special Pythagorean triplet
* A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
* a2 + b2 = c2
